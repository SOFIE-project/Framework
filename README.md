SOFIE Federation Framework

The current version of the [SOFIE](https://www.sofie-iot.eu) Federation Framework consists of following components:

* [Interledger](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/interledger-asset-transfer), which provides support for operations spanning two or more ledgers.

* [Identity, Authentication and Authorisation](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/IAA), which provides IAA functionalities for the different entities in the system by supporting multiple authentication and authorisation techniques.

* [Privacy and Data Sovereignty](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Privacy-and-Data-Sovereignty), which provides mechanisms that enable data sharing in a controlled and privacy preserving way.

* [Semantic Representation](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Semantic-Representation), which is used to enable interoperability between different IoT devices, services, and data by describing what functions they provide and what interfaces and formats they utilise.

* [Marketplace](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/offer-marketplace), which allows participants to trade resources by placing bids and offers in a secure, auditable, and decentralised way.

* [Discovery & provisioning](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Discovery-and-Provisioning), which provides functionality for the discovery and bootstrapping of IoT devices, services, and data.
