# SOFIE Framework

The SOFIE Framework is an example implementation of the SOFIE Federation Architecture developed by the [SOFIE Project](https://www.sofie-iot.eu). The Framework consists of 6 components:

* [Interledger](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Interledger), which provides support for operations spanning two or more ledgers.

* [Identity, Authentication and Authorisation](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/identity-authentication-authorization), which provides IAA functionalities for the different entities in the system by supporting multiple authentication and authorisation techniques.

* [Privacy and Data Sovereignty](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Privacy-and-Data-Sovereignty), which provides mechanisms that enable data sharing in a controlled and privacy preserving way.

* [Semantic Representation](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Semantic-Representation), which is used to enable interoperability between different IoT devices, services, and data by describing what functions they provide and what interfaces and formats they utilise.

* [Marketplace](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Marketplace), which allows participants to trade resources by placing bids and offers in a secure, auditable, and decentralised way.

* [Discovery & provisioning](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Discovery-and-Provisioning), which provides functionality for the discovery and bootstrapping of IoT devices, services, and data.

Finally, [Federation Adapters](https://github.com/SOFIE-project/Federation-Adapters) connect IoT resources to the SOFIE Framework without requiring any changes to the resources themselves.
